Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
bike0 <- read_csv(here::here("data", "bikes.csv"))


# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))

bike
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static/aboutme", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, get_tfl_dat, cache=TRUE}
#We first start by calculating the historic monthly average between 2015 and 2019

  filter(year %in% c(2015,2016,2017,2018,2019))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
