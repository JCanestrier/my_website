Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static/aboutme", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
#We first start by calculating the historic monthly average between 2015 and 2019
historic_average <- bike %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015,2016,2017,2018,2019))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  summarise(monthly_historic_average=mean(bikes_hired, na.rm = TRUE))
historic_average

#Second, we calculate the monthly average for each year since 2015
monthly_bike <- bike %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020))%>%
