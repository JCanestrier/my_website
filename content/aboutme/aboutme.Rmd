Born in the south of France and raised by French parents in Las Vegas, I am currently an MFA student at London Business School pursuing a career in the financial industry.

As a child, I was always curious and keen to learn new things and I believe this still holds true today. Hence, I am always interested to learn new things from a diverse set of people. Having lived in the United States, France, Netherlands, Hong Kong and now London, I have acquired a global mindset and I aim to continue to develop this diverse mindset. Please feel free to get in touch!
